This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is it?
This is a personal website. Initially, I started blogging on WordPress. However, given the cost of hosting and the choices we get in terms of themes I had to switch to something custom.
This blog utilizes [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) for content handling and [shadcn UI](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui).

## What's different?

coming from WordPress one is used to using slugs like `https://www.iabhi.com/example-post` rather than `https://www.iabhi.com/blog/example-post`
That's what is going on here, all the blog posts are rendered just under the domain name by dropping the `blog` from the slug.

What about pages? Since I'm using only two pages, both are hardcoded to avoid complexity... or due to lack of knowledge on how to route them üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è.

## What's next?

1. Using a responsive mobile menu
2. SEO and meta tags
3. TOC
4. Using [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/docs/)
