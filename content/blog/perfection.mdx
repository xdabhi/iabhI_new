Perfection, in my opinion, is one of the most contradictory words. Let me explain why.  
_**The F A C T:**_  _Nothing is perfect_, it is like achieving 100% efficiency. Which is impossible by the laws of nature.

As soon as one is complacent, they think that it is perfect. And achieving that level is perfection. As I mentioned earlier, nothing is perfect. Even the level you achieve and find satisfactory is not perfect.  _There is always room for improvement!_

Alright, so shall we stop using the word perfection? No, of course not. Well, it is what it is. The pursuit of perfection. Keep doing that.

The key point is satisfaction. When you think you did well, you move on to the next task. And thus you do not look back. This positive aspect of being satisfied. Also, you accumulate knowledge with each task and apply them to the next one.

The same thing applies to a task that is divided into multiple stages. Believe me, I have been planning this blog for years. I wanted it to be perfect. And every time I did something, I went back to square one.

I wrote many articles. Yet you will find none. That’s because we do not express ourselves due to the fear of being judged.

While pursuing perfection, you may not explore all dimensions/perspective by doing the same task again and again. Thus, it gives a little knowledge or idea in each iteration. This is a negative part of pursuing perfection.

Most people pursue perfection because they don’t want to be judged. Without such feedback or constructive criticism, there is very little room left for improvement. I’ll read what I wrote above again and again and I won’t improve much. Believe me,  _**you’ll point out all the mistakes that I made.**_  And that’s how it works.
